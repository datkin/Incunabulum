# Incunabulum

The J Incunabulum refers to some C code in this "essay":

I find it rather inscrutable, though I wonder if the author, Arthur Whitney,
finds it self-explanatory [1]:

  BC By raising the level of abstraction, you make it easier for things to be
  correct by inspection.

  AW Yes. I have about 1,000 customers around the world in different banks and
  hedge funds on the equity side (where everything's going fine). I think the
  ratio of comment to code for them is actually much greater than one. I never
  comment anything because I'm always trying to make it so the code itself is the
  comment.
